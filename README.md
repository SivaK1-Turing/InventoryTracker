InventoryTracker is a powerful, terminal‐based Python application designed to help small businesses or developers manage product inventories with confidence. At its core, it lets you define products, record stock movements in and out, search and filter items, generate low‐stock alerts and reorder reports, persist data across multiple backends, analyze usage trends, and schedule notifications—all from the command line with a consistent, extensible interface.
