InventoryTracker is a powerful, terminal‐based Python application designed to help small businesses or developers manage product inventories with confidence. At its core, it lets you define products, record stock movements in and out, search and filter items, generate low‐stock alerts and reorder reports, persist data across multiple backends, analyze usage trends, and schedule notifications—all from the command line with a consistent, extensible interface.

Project Features Mapped to Conversations

- Conversation 1: We’ll kick off by laying down the foundation of InventoryTracker: a clean package structure, a Typer-based entrypoint, and an auto-discovered commands system. You’ll build a layered configuration loader that merges defaults, a user’s TOML file, environment variables, and command‐line flags, all validated by Pydantic. We’ll wire up structured logging (with optional Rich styling) and a global exception handler that logs detailed traces while presenting friendly, concise messages to the user. Finally, you’ll add a graceful shutdown routine and a Markdown-driven help system, plus an integration-test harness to ensure the CLI starts up correctly and displays exactly the help text you’ve written.
  
- Conversation 2: Next, we’ll define our Product data model using Pydantic for robust schema validation—fields like UUID, name, SKU regex, price, and reorder levels enforced automatically. You’ll create a ProductFactory with pre-save sanitizers and post-save hooks, then build an interactive “add-product” wizard that loops on invalid input, checks for duplicate SKUs, and shows a styled confirmation panel. To keep the CLI responsive, we’ll enqueue new products into an asynchronous persistence queue, and you’ll write both unit tests for the factory and end-to-end tests for the add flow, ensuring that products land in your store exactly as expected.
  
- Conversation 3: Once products exist, it’s time to move stock. You’ll introduce a StockTransaction model capturing product references, positive or negative deltas, timestamps, and optional notes. A transaction factory will guard against negative inventory and emit low-stock events when thresholds are crossed. We’ll implement a transact command that lets you pick a product by fuzzy name or SKU, apply in/out quantities, and immediately display the last five transactions in a colored table. An async consumer will batch-write transactions to the backend, and you’ll cover all logic with unit tests and an integration test that runs a transact sequence end-to-end.

- Conversation 4: With stock movements flowing in, you’ll need powerful search and listing capabilities. We’ll design a fluent SearchQuery DSL to combine filters—by tag, name, SKU, date range, and even full-text matches—compiled to either SQL or in-memory predicates. To keep results lightning-fast, you’ll maintain inverted indexes in memory and integrate SQLite FTS5 for fuzzy name searches. The list-products command will accept multi-column sort syntax and cursor-based pagination for stable navigation through large datasets. You’ll also add async bulk export to CSV/JSONL, write parametrized tests covering filter/sort/pagination combos, and benchmark 95th-percentile latency on thousands of items.
  
- Conversation 5: We’ll build on your analytics by detecting which products have fallen below their reorder levels. A list-reorders command will display these with urgency scores (and optional Rich progress bars), and you’ll add an Excel export for quick reorder sheets. To automate the process, you’ll set up a scheduler to run low-stock detection each morning and wire in an EmailNotifier adapter that sends you the daily report. You’ll write unit tests for detection logic and scheduler behavior, plus an integration test that mocks the email backend to confirm your alerts fire when they should.
  
- Conversation 6: Behind the scenes, we’ll swap your in-memory store for a pluggable adapter interface, implementing both a SQLite backend (with lightweight migrations via a schema_version table) and a JSONLines backend for easy dev testing. You’ll create import-data and export-data commands supporting CSV/JSON with transactional semantics, streaming large files efficiently. A sync command will migrate between adapters, and you’ll cover both adapters with parametrized unit tests. Finally, you’ll benchmark read/write performance for tens of thousands of records and document the results so users can choose the right backend.

- Conversation 7: Now that data is flowing and stored, we’ll turn to insights: you’ll implement functions to compute average daily usage per product and forecast depletion dates based on recent transaction history. The analytics command will present current stock, usage trends, depletion forecasts, and even ASCII sparklines for the last two weeks. You’ll cache results and invalidate them on new transactions, then use Hypothesis to property-test forecasting invariants under random workloads. A performance benchmark will ensure response times remain under 200 ms for thousands of products, and you’ll expose plugin hooks for adding custom metrics.

- Conversation 8: To close the loop, we’ll build a pluggable notifications system: define a Notifier interface and implement both an SMTP-based EmailNotifier and an HTTP POST WebhookNotifier, complete with retry and back-off logic. The notify-low-stock command will gather low-stock items and broadcast alerts via all configured notifiers. We’ll integrate a scheduler for daily notifications, respecting “quiet hours” and opt-out flags. Comprehensive unit and integration tests will mock external services to verify correct payloads and scheduling behavior, and final documentation will guide users through setup, scheduling, and troubleshooting.
